It all started with questions. Someone trying to look for his way through an unfamiliar place need not try out all possible routes, he just needs to ask passers-by questions or use a map. By doing so, he saves time. Elaborate procedures for carrying out certain medical operations are usually written down in order to help the inexperienced doctor avoid making mistakes. Humans document their discoveries and this is what distinguishes them as intelligent. 
What good would it do to undergo the same processes the author of a book had to go through in order to produce the book? In order words, would it be wise to try and reinvent the wheel so as to come up with the same wheel again? 
The later generation builds upon the works of the previous generation. This is why the former generation can never be smarter than the present. 
Before calculators (the first form of computers) were made, humans mostly made use of their mental ability to do arithmetic. However, has being unable to calculate 1227 x 234 within 10 secs without a calculator, made the present generation dumber or handicapped in some way? It didn't. What was lost in being able to use only the head was made up for in the speed and dexterity of the individual handling the calculator. Automation is as old as man himself and this has enabled him to perform several tasks significantly faster.
The first programmers actually programmed in binary but to eliminate the need for writing or memorizing several sets of binary numbers, Assembly was invented. This too proved difficult to work with and other languages like Basic, Pascal, Fortran and C followed. High level languages were later developed to eliminate the need to deal with low level stuff which often proved tedious and error prone. This wasn't enough, libraries were developed for these languages which did much of the heavy lifting for programmers. 
Was this enough? 
Programmers needed a way to write code fast and accurately so IDE's were developed. THE ERA OF MACHINE LEARNING
You only just have to describe what you want be it a program or an image and you'll get a result almost instantly. Things that were impossible or very difficult for humans to do can now be done easily with artificial intelligence. As AI is being fed with more data, concerns are raised as to whether it'll eventually be capable of performing every mental activity humans can do. Humans take pride in their work and demand credit for it, therefore, having a "robot" to do all that feels like cheating. Some are like, "so we'll all be fired from our jobs?" As a result, they have consoled themselves with the thought that AI is making slow advancements and that there's a big difference between a human and an ordinary robot, that AI can never be creative and that AI cannot be operated without humans. Most of those who adopt this idea do so because they actually fear being replaced in their jobs or they're underestimating the capability of AI.
But this is where they fail to see the reality....
Humans take pride in being the most intelligent of all living species and having this title given to something that doesn't even have life is sad news for many. 
I think a closer analysis of the matter would help humans to see where all of this is headed.
Humans are problem solvers and are creative; this is pretty much what they do every time. It's something most of us have begun to think is inherent and cannot be imitated by any other thing else. However, what is problem solving and creativity by the way? 
Given a problem, humans first understand the problem, this process mostly involves eliminating any ambiguities in the language used to present the problem and defining certain unfamiliar terminologies or vocabulary. When the problem is understood, the next step is solving the problem. To do so, the problem is broken into sub-problems and tackled one at a time. How is a problem tackled? The human first checks his database of solved problems in his memory to see if the present problems has already been solved. If it is not, he then has to employ creativity.
Humans mostly use creativity when they haven't been given any aid. The solution to many, seems to come out of thin air and those who exercise this skill effectively are seen as geniuses. But what is creativity? Is it a mysterious ability only a lesser part of the human population possess?
Actually, creativity is not something mysterious. It's basically the ability to find and connect the dots. 
In this world of infinite possibilities, there are patterns which come as obvious to many, but there are also hidden patterns which only a few are able to find. The majority of the population can clearly see how a tape can be used to measure an object, but comparatively few can see how tapes laid out perpendicularly can describe the position of an object in 2d space.
How do humans see patterns? How do they come up with that which most of us call "genius idea"?
There's usually a logical connection that leads to any result. Most times, the connection is not obvious, primarily because it doesn't match any previous experiences the human has. It therefore takes an unbiased and curious mind to employ unfamiliar approaches and to seek the solution where it has never been found. Creativity is the ability to see the hidden connections. It is being able to explore and use various possibilities. 
Can AI be creative? Some have called AI only a "mimic" but who on earth can ever boast of formulating an original idea without having any experience with something related whatsoever? Humans don't bring out ideas out of thin air, there's usually an underlying connection with other experiences the human already had. Hence, humans are mimics and it's expected that AI—our creation would also be mimics. Humans can learn to be creative and this is because creativity itself has a defined method. Whatever has a rule can be mimicked. Therefore, since creativity involves exploring several possibilities, AI can be creative by learning how to explore different approaches when faced with a problem. Is it difficult to do?
AI is creative already. With its speed, it has outmatched most humans in being creative. It is not limited by memory loss or fatigue and can easily find and connect the dots in the massive data it is trained with. 
In the field of programming, it can greatly help with debugging and with producing code. It's just a matter of time before it replaces most programmers since almost all the work done by them can be done even more efficiently and cheaper with AI. But will all programmers be replaced? Who will be the programmers that would remain?This realization about AI grieved me greatly because this is something I want to make a career out of. And if AI would be doing my job, what's the need of trying to do what AI can do even better? Is there a need to learn to be a creative problem solver?
DISCOVERY—PART OF THE LEARNING PROCESS
Humans learn new things by making new discoveries. This is why  development depends greatly on those in any field of research. A discovery can either be related to something we already know or be something totally new to us. However, it is the usefulness of a discovery that makes it valuable. Hence, discovery is part of the problem solving process and is one of the characteristics of creativity. Discovery is difficult and can't be done by everyone because it involves using exactly the right methods and tools. But even with these, a human may ignore a potentially valuable discovery. That is why in addition to using the right methods, to make a successful discovery, the human must have the necessary skills to be able to know a good discovery when he encounters one. How is discovery done?
To find out something new, then a lot of observation needs to be made. The human keeps an eye out for inconsistencies or consistencies in the environment. If it is a consistency, then he has discovered a pattern or a tool which can be useful to making even other discoveries. If it is an inconsistency, the human has just discovered a new problem which needs a solution!  
The whole purpose of being creative or smart or intelligent, is to be able to solve problems, which is why problem-solving is a highly prized skill in the human race. 
AI, while being capable of solving problems can't make discoveries on it's own. The human has always been the rider of the horse. At present, AI can't find out the inconsistencies or consistencies and at the same time do something useful with what it has found. It all lies in the power of humans to know what to do with whatever information AI gives them from the data it was trained with. And the reason for this is because humans would always have problems and which only humans are good at finding out because we can relate. 
AI, therefore, is here to help solve the problems which humans discover. Humans should recognize their main role, which is, identifying new problems. All along, we've been building machines and tools to solve our problems but we've never built something that finds out what our problem is (before we even know its a problem) and solves it. 
What's there to deduce from all of this? It's simple:
Change your role from a problem solver to a problem identifier. Problem solvers are tools/robots/AI, problem identifiers are human. 
Just how soon will AI replace your job? Ask yourself if your current role involves identifying and/or solving new problems. If it is, enjoy your prolonged job security. If it's not, consider changing your role coz you're not a tool but a human. HOW ALL OF THIS HAS AFFECTED ME PERSONALLY
I was very relieved after realizing all of this. It actually changed the way I approach learning. You see, as a beginner programmer (currently doing The Odin Project but I also study with books), I try to master every "how this can be done", hence, I spend a great deal of time in learning everything about the language features and syntax and how they're used to solve certain problems. The reason for this is because I want to be a well-rounded programmer, fluent in the languages I'm working with and to impress anyone with my breadth and depth of knowledge. I should have realized that the era of this type of mentality has long gone. Programming languages and all the bells and whistles each one has are all just a means to an end. And like physical tools, they actually evolve, though, at a much rapid rate. Just as physical laws govern the way a tool can be used, so also are the languages and frameworks bounded by programming logic. Why master a tool when I can master the laws?? If I master the language feature/framework/syntax, my mastery becomes obsolete in a few years or even months, but if I master the laws, my mastery stays viable for as long as the tools depend on the laws. The usage of these language features are well documented and even more exciting is that we have Chatgpt (and the rest) which can tell us about the tool immediately. My learning has therefore changed from trying to find out "how something can be done with this" to "what is this used for". The answer to the latter is basically the rule/law. This style of thinking makes the learning process faster since I only have to know what is possible. There's no point in trying to remember the syntax of declaring a nested dictionary in Python. I am satisfied with knowing that such a feature exists and that it has so and so use case. If my memory fails me, chatgpt is just a few swipes away, I solve the present problem and get on with life. 
The only way to be ahead of the game in this rapidly evolving field in tech is to know what's possible and to know what the features are meant for. AI is here to do the dirty work of memorizing new syntax. Humans should do what they're meant for—identifying and solving new problems. But there's something. Remember that to make a good discovery, one needs the right skills. These skills gives such person a clearer eye to look for opportunities. Likewise, a total beginner to programming can't make any new discoveries if he hasn't learn programming. The foundations of programming rests on computer science. This is where the laws are. I have therefore made it my goal to place more focus on CS concepts and subjects, and also to master the languages which exposes me to the raw laws of coding; namely, ASM and C/C++ (and linux; its a technology btw) By doing so, I can know what's possible in coding and the rest is just a matter of learning what other languages can do and picking whatever tool does the job better. 
I now want to learn all I can in order to have the right skills to be able to solve new problems. This is how I can still be valuable during the revolution. The programmers who would still be left are those who with the aid of AI, solve new problems.
Just like someone lost who asks questions to find his way instead of exploring all the paths possible, I no longer try to spend all my time solving problems that already have solutions. I'm more interested in problems that are unique. Given a problem, I try to understand it and then study the solution (if it has), taking note of important techniques upon which the solution was built. There's literally no point in reinventing the wheel because time is precious.
I think high schools should adopt this idea. Students should only be given new problems to solve in their exams. However, pupils should be trained with old problems since they're yet to develop their reasoning ability. 
In summary it's this:
1. Learn the foundation
2. Learn to solve new problems
3. Solve new problemsWHEN DISCOVERY BECOMES AUTOMATED
To identify what a problem is to a human, then AI or AGI would have to study all the needs and wants of humans. This is no easy feat since it would involve having a physical interaction with the environment that surrounds all humans. It must be able to experience what it means to be human. Only then can it look for inconsistencies and find ways to solve them. Humans would no longer have to identify problems since discovery would be automated. When would this be? Haha, not anytime soon. Until then, humans would be safe in their role as problem identifiers.
